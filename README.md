# Alfred Emoji Pack

PHP Script to generate Snippets for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with all the latest available Emojis. (Currently includes up to Emoji 13.0 characters)

## Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [califa/alfred-emoji-pack](https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack). (I helped adding a build step in [#1](https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack/pull/1)).
However, I'm more comfortable in PHP than in JavaScript. That's how this project was born.

My goal with this project is to automatically generate an always up-to-date Emoji pack for Alfred. A future version will use the [Unicode](https://unicode.org) website as its source for the available emojis.

## Usage
Download the file "Emoji Pack.alfredsnippets" from the latest [release](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/alfred-emoji-pack/releases) and open the file in Alfred.

## When are new Emojis added?
The project currently depends on [wooorm/gemoji](https://github.com/wooorm/gemoji), which itself depends on [github/gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji). Therefore new Emojis are added whenever `wooorm/gemoji` receives a new release.

As the update cycle for both of the packages is quite slow, I would like to skip them entirely. I'm already working on a project which automatically creates a library of all available emojis based on the [Unicode](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/) website.
As soon as that new package is finished this project will be updated.

## Local Development

The project requires PHP 8, Nodejs and `yarn`.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install NPM dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Install PHP dependencies with `composer install`
4. Do your thing âœ¨

## Generate New Pack

To generate a new pack or build, the NPM and PHP dependencies need to be installed.
Then run the following command in your terminal.

```
php app generate
```

The generate pack is located in the root of the project as "Emoji Pack.alfredsnippets".
